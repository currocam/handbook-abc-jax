Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms implemented in JAX. 

This repository contains various ABC algorithms (from the [bible of ABC](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315117195)) and others I've found interesting. 

## TODO

1. [Expectation-propagation algorithms for likelihood-free inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00205)
2. [Inverse Binomial Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03985)

## Caveat Emptor

Parts of this repository were written with LLM assistance.
